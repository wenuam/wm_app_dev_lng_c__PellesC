A cool template tool for Pelles C. It contains templates for various compound statements, dialog procedures, windows procedures, a very smooth structure builder, message crackers for Windows controls, ASCII table, and lots more. You can even add your own templates! It's freeware and open source. This is a great contribution and time saver!

First build the project, then install it in the IDE like this:

Choose **Tools** -> **Customize** and click the New tool button. Enter the menu text, for example "C templates wizard". Enter the command: "<install path>**cwiz.exe**". Click OK.
