A wizard for creating new project wizards (recursive programming?). This is the source code of the wizard-wizard available from the **download** page.

With this you can start building your own wizards. Maybe you don't like the code generated for a new project by one of the standard wizards? Build your own!

The finished DLL must be copied to install path**\Bin\Wizards**, and the IDE must be restarted, before you can see the wizard in the New Project dialog.
