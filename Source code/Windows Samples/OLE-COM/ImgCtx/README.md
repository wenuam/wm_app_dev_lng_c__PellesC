Sample that demonstrates loading and displaying images from an URL (a local file or a web address), using the IImgCtx interface from Internet Explorer. Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WMF and ICO. The only references I can find is for Internet Explorer 5.5 (and later). Not sure if it works with earlier versions.
